# tumour-classification
Using matlab as the platform, 
i wanted to use Otsu's thresholding method to create a binary image, 
then k-means clustering to group the data, 
DWT to extract the features and finally SVM to classify the tumour from the brain as benign or malign.
The boundary box
The otsu's thresholding and svm aspects are done, i need to work on DWT for feature extraction to find out of its malign or not.
